TDict is FREE, man, so, like, dig it, and be FREE!
(Copy of the GPL is included).
Look up some words and stuff.
TDict requires Tcl/Tk on mac and linux
Mac folks, get Tcl here:
http://www.activestate.com/store/productdetail.aspx?prdGuid=f0cd6399-fefb-466e-ba17-220dcd6f4078

Linux folks, install Tcl (8.5 or newer) with your distribution's package manager (apt, yum, whatever).

Windows folks, we have an .exe file that already has tcl bundled,
so no worries, you need not install tcl to run that, however,
if you want to run from the source .tcl file, you will need it.
Get it also from ActiveTcl (url above).

Control-C copies text, etc.
Escape <Esc> exits.

You can save a definition as a text file.
Increase font and/or change background color for
comfort and ease of reading.
